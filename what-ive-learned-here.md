# 🏦 Java Learning Log: The "One Scanner" Architecture

## 🎯 The Core Problem
In Java, `System.in` (keyboard input) is a shared resource. If you create multiple Scanners for the same input, they will conflict. We solve this by creating **one machine** and sharing its **address** (locator) with every class that needs it.

## 🏗️ 1. Reference vs. Object (Pointer vs. Machine)

There is a major difference between **declaring** a variable and **instantiating** an object.

### A. The Pointer (Declaration)
`Scanner scan;`
- **What it is:** A **Reference Variable**.
- **Analogy:** A **Remote Control** with no TV yet.
- **Memory Location:** Lives on the **Stack**.
- **State:** It is currently `null` (pointing to nothing). It has the *potential* to control a machine, but the "brain" isn't connected yet.



### B. The Machine (Instantiation)
`new Scanner(System.in);`
- **What it is:** The **Object Instance**.
- **Analogy:** The **Physical TV Machine**.
- **Memory Location:** Lives in the **Heap** (The Warehouse).
- **Logic:** The `new` keyword builds the actual machine. This machine knows how to "work" and listen to your keyboard.

### C. The Connection (Assignment)
`Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);`
- **Logic:** This connects the **Pointer** to the **Machine**. 
- **The Secret:** The variable `scan` doesn't "hold" your text; it holds the **Memory Address** (the locator) of the machine.

## 🧠 2. The Big Picture: Stack vs. Heap

To understand why "passing the scanner" works, we look at how Java organizes memory into two worlds.

| Feature | The Stack (Workspace) | The Heap (Warehouse) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What lives there** | Pointers and `int`/`String` names | Big Objects (Scanner, Bank, etc.) |
| **Speed** | Extremely Fast | Massive Space / Shared Area |
| **Analogy** | A Post-it note with a GPS address | The actual House at that address |
