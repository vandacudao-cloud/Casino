What is bank money?
Bank money is like the wallet of the user in this game

-additional info-

In the bank player will not input a number on the screen it will be automatically have money based on the program. So the programmer will set it manually so when you open it it will have the money. user can go back here everytime he enter back in casino menu

-PRESS ENTER-
after the user press enter it will go direct to casino menu 1. to input the name but if player had alrdy name it will go to casino menu 2.

so if player dont have name go to casino menu 1 which is automatic if the game did just started. but later on if player had alrdy name it will go to casino menu 2.
